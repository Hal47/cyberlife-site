  <p><i>`A year here and he still dreamed of cyberspace, hope fading 
nightly. All the speed he took, all the turns he'd taken and the corners
 he cut in Night City, and he'd still see the matrix in his dreams, 
bright lattices of logic unfolding across that colourless void... The 
Sprawl was a long, strange way home now over the Pacific, and he was no 
Console Man, no cyberspace cowboy. Just another hustler, trying to make 
it through. But the dreams came on in the Japanese night like livewire 
voodoo, and he'd cry for it, cry in his sleep, and wake alone in the 
dark, curled in his capsule in some coffin hotel, hands clawed into the 
bedslab, temper foam bunched between his fingers, trying to reach the 
console that wasn't there.' </i></p>

    All the schway terms you might come across</p>
    <p><a href="https://lainchan.org">Cyberpunk page on the /g/ wiki</a><br>
    There's probably going to be lots of redundant content, but who cares?</p>
    <p><a href="https://lainchan.org">Project Cyberpunk</a><br>
    A fantastic resource for everything from plaintext of Gibson's stories to the history of cyberpunk.</p>
    <p><a href="https://lainchan.org">Cyberpunk forum</a><br>
    A continuation of the Cyberpunk Review forums. Quality of content varies.</p>
    <p><a href="https://lainchan.org">Cyberpunk board on 8chan</a> 8CHAN IS DEAD<br>
    Our home sweet home. RIP in piss, halfchan.</p>
    <s><p><a href="https://lainchan.org">Cyberpunk board on megachan</a><br>
    Tripfag circlejerk, and pretty dead to boot. Still better than /r/cyberpunk though</s> Megachan is kill. RIP in piss.</p>
    <p><a href="https://lainchan.org">Cyberpunk Review</a><br>
    Excellent resource that publishes reviews of cyberpunk-related games, anime, movies, and other media.</p>
    <p><a href="https://lainchan.org">Cyberadio</a><br>
    Neo-80s/cyberpunk themed internet radio from Spry. <s>May be dead</s> Alive and well!

    LA police scanner, overlaid with random ambient electronic music. 
Incredibly chill. There are a few others with different cities.</p>

      Remember, <a href="https://lainchan.org">we're living in a cyberpunk reality</a>, just a slightly less glitzy one than Gibson envisioned.<br>These are to help you out in this brave new world.
          <p><a href="https://lainchan.org">The Gentooman's Library</a><br>
          The official Gentooman's Library. A truly massive collection 
of books, covering everything from basic HTML to artificial 
intelligence. Availability varies, so <a href="https://lainchan.org">here</a> is a magnet link.</p>
          <p><a href="https://lainchan.org">Dumpster diving how-to</a><br>
          A /g/uide to dumpster diving for fun, profit, and free electronics, written by yours truly.</p>
          <p><a href="https://lainchan.org">Magnet link for the Do/k/ument</a><br>
          A massive torrent of stuff related to guns and shit, courtesy 
of /k/. There is no reason in the modern world to not be prepared to 
defend yourself. I'm not responsible for what you do with this 
information, and there's better stuff out there for people who are new 
to firearms, but this is a good resource. It's not being fully seeded, 
but the only thing missing is some shitty magpul videos.</p>
          <p><a href="https://lainchan.org">The Well-Cultured Anonymous</a><br>
          From back before anything to do with "anonymous" was 
associated with edgy 14-year-olds wearing Guy Fawkes masks. A guide to 
help /b/tards improve themselves (i.e. not be fat permavirgin 
neckbeards). Still relevant to you, you NEET fuck. </p>
          <p><a href="https://lainchan.org">(GNU/)Linux for Beginners</a><br>
          You can't let the man get you down, man. Use a freedom-respecting OS. This should help with the basics.</p>
          <p><a href="https://lainchan.org">More (GNU/)Linux for Beginners</a><br>
          Someone in IRC said this is very comprehensive, and it looks 
pretty good, so enjoy. Probably better than the link above, since I just
 looked up "linux for beginners" and copied the first relevant link</p>
          <p><a href="https://lainchan.org">Becoming a Sysadmin</a><br>
          Are you a cynical fuck that hates people? Do you have no 
qualms about working for The Man, knowing that being a cyberpunk won't 
fill a retirement fund? Do you want to get paid for doing shit that you 
probably do anyway? Would you forgo the soft caress of a woman in favor 
of the cold metal of server racks and the humming of fans? A position as
 a Sysadmin (or Systems Administrator) might be just the thing for you!</p>
          <p><a href="https://lainchan.org" target="_blank">Prism-Break</a><br>
	Great site about things you can do to stop government surveillance and how to have your devices respect your freedom.</p>
		  <p><a href="https://lainchan.org">OffPocket</a><br>
		  Put your phone in this to stop the government from spying on it, and to stop your phone from spying on you. The schway kobuns know that you can save money by just using a few of the kevlar bags that new components come in, though.</p>
		  <p><a href="https://lainchan.org">Stealth wear</a><br>
		  This is supposed to protect you from drones. I think it's kinda bullshit, driven mostly by paranoia (not the good kind) and buzzwords. Still interesting, though.</p>

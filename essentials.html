I'm not going to outright tell you what cyberpunk is. That's for you to work out. The first thing you should do is read a bit. William Gibson is viewed as the father of cyberpunk, and some of his writing is downright prophetic. If you're ambitious, you could tackle <a href="http://project.cyberpunk.ru/lib/neuromancer/">Neuromancer</a>, the book that started it all. 
<br><br>
If you're less ambitious, read Burning Chrome (<a href="http://mith.umd.edu/digitalstorytelling/wp-content/uploads/GibsonW_Burning_Chrome.pdf">PDF</a>, <a href="http://cla.calpoly.edu/~lcall/354/gibson.html"> HTML</a>) a short story by Gibson that predated Neuromancer. 
<br><br>
There's also an anthology called Burning Chrome, you should read that too at some point. It's not all cyberpunk, but almost all of it is pure scifi gold. <b>These are optional, but reccomended.</b> For your convenience, the cyberpunk stories are:
<li><a href="http://project.cyberpunk.ru/lib/johnny_mnemonic/">Johnny Mnemonic</a></li>
<li><a href="http://lib.ru/GIBSON/frag_rose.txt">Fragments of a Hologram Rose</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.lib.ru/GIBSON/hotel.txt">New Rose Hotel</a></li> 
<li><a href="http://lib.ru/GIBSON/r_dogfight.txt">Dogfight</a></li>
<li>And the titular <a href="http://cla.calpoly.edu/~lcall/354/gibson.html">Burning Chrome</a></li>
<br>
It's also worth reading the short story <a href="http://project.cyberpunk.ru/lib/cyberpunk/">Cyberpunk</a> by Bruce Bethke, where the term was first invented.
<br><br><br>
On to watchable media. The first one to mention is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/">Blade Runner</a> (<a href="magnet:?xt=urn:btih:20224c98d559f7c1aec4326e2a01648439928ae7&dn=Blade+Runner+%281982%29+1080p+5.1+Blu-ray+%5BUltimate+Cut%5D&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.publicbt.com%3A80&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.istole.it%3A6969&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337">magnet link here</a>). Gibson walked out halfway through when he first saw it, because he didn't want people to think he was ripping it off for Neuromancer.
<br><br>
The next one is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113568/">Ghost in the Shell</a> (<a href="http://bakabt.me/download/171377/1417370384/cc58f420931527330c35948ef981342b/697441/koukaku-kidoutai-ghost-in-the-shell-1995-bd-1080p-niizk.torrent">torrent</a>). Not much needs to be said here, besides that it's a true classic and a must-watch.
<br><br>
There's a surprising lack of cyberpunk games out there. The best I can reccomend are <b>Deus Ex</b> and <b>Deus Ex: Human Revolution</b>. While I personally haven't played DX, I can vouch for DXHR's cyberpunk quality. It gets the aesthetic down perfectly. You can find a download for that yourself (make sure you get the director's cut). If you're into retro stuff, Based Kojima's "Snatcher" might be good for you.  
<br><br>
That's all you need to get started. Have fun, chummer. Poke around the site, visit <a href="https://8chan.co/cyber/">/cyber/</a>, avoid /r/cyberpunk on reddit, and have fun. Welcome to the club.

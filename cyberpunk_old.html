      <p><i>`A year here and he still dreamed of cyberspace, hope fading nightly. All the speed he took, all the turns he'd taken and the corners he cut in Night City, and he'd still see the matrix in his dreams, bright lattices of logic unfolding across that colourless void... The Sprawl was a long, strange way home now over the Pacific, and he was no Console Man, no cyberspace cowboy. Just another hustler, trying to make it through. But the dreams came on in the Japanese night like livewire voodoo, and he'd cry for it, cry in his sleep, and wake alone in the dark, curled in his capsule in some coffin hotel, hands clawed into the bedslab, temper foam bunched between his fingers, trying to reach the console that wasn't there.' </i><br> -Neuromancer</p>

      <p>This is the original version, made web 1.0 style. You probably want <a href="cyberlife.neocitied.org">this</a></p>

      <p>Don't forget to stop by our IRC: #/g/punk on rizon</p>
      <p>Cyberpunk-related content</p>
        <ul>
          <p><li><a href="http://wiki.installgentoo.com/index.php?title=Cyberpunk">Cyberpunk page on the /g/ wiki</a></li>
          There's probably going to be lots of redundant content, but who cares?</p>
          <p><li><a href="http://project.cyberpunk.ru/idb/">Project Cyberpunk</a></li>
          A fantastic resource for everything from plaintext of Gibson's stories to the history of cyberpunk.</p>
          <p><li><a href="http://cyberpunkforums.com/">Cyberpunk forum</a></li>
          A continuation of the Cyberpunk Review forums. Quality of content varies.</p>
          <p><li><a href="https://8chan.co/cy/">Cyberpunk board on 8chan</a></li>
          Alternate place to post stuff. If you submit content to go on here, please post it on 8chan as well. It moves so slowly that things won't 404, so I'll actually see stuff without having to monitor /g/ constantly.</p>
          <p><li><a href="http://www.megachan.net/cy/">Cyberpunk board on megachan</a></li>
          Tripfag circlejerk, and pretty dead to boot. Still better than /r/cyberpunk though.</p>
          <p><li><a href="http://www.cyberpunkreview.com/">Cyberpunk Review</a></li>
          Excellent resource that publishes reviews of cyberpunk-related games, anime, movies, and other media.</p>
          <p><li><a href="http://cyberadio.pw:8000/mpd.m3u">Cyberadio</a></li>
          Neo-80s/cyberpunk themed internet radio from Spry. WIP.
          </p>
          <p><li><a href="http://youarelisteningtolosangeles.com/">You Are Listening To: Los Angeles</a></li>
          LA police scanner, overlaid with random ambient electronic music. Incredibly chill. There are a few others with different cities.</p>
          <p><li><a href="http://fauux.neocities.org/">Fauux's Serial Experiments Lain tribute</a></li>
          Lain is mai waifu though, so don't get any ideas </p>
          
        </ul>
      <p>Cyberpunk-related media directories (totally unfinished, most of this will be from the /r/cyberpunk wiki, but please submit anything you think belongs)</p>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        
      <p>And here, we have links to things that are actually useful. Remember, <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/12/psa-why-there-wont-be-a-third-.html">we're living in a cyberpunk reality</a>, just a slightly less glitzy one than Gibson envisioned. These are to help you out in this brave new world.</p>
        <ul>  
          <p><li><a href="http://books.gentoomen.org/">The Gentooman's Library</a></li>
          The official Gentooman's Library. A truly massive collection of books, covering everything from basic HTML to artificial intelligence.</p>
          <p><li><a href="./dumpster_diving.html">Dumpster diving how-to</a></li>
          A /g/uide to dumpster diving for fun, profit, and free electronics, written by yours truly.</p>

          A massive torrent of stuff related to guns and shit, courtesy of /k/. There is no reason in the modern world to not be prepared to defend yourself. I'm not responsible for what you do with this information, and there's better stuff out there for people who are new to firearms, but this is a good resource. It's not being fully seeded, but the only thing missing is some shitty magpul videos.</p>
          <p><li><a href="https://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki/The-Return-of-the-Well-Cultured-Anonymous">The Well-Cultured Anonymous</a></li>
          From back before anything to do with "anonymous" was associated with edgy 14-year-olds wearing Guy Fawkes masks. A guide to help /b/tards improve themselves (i.e. not be fat permavirgin neckbeards). Still relevant to you, you NEET fuck. </p>
          <p><li><a href="http://www.linux.org/forums/beginner-tutorials.53/">(GNU/)Linux for Beginners</a></li>
          You can't let the man get you down, man. Use a freedom-respecting OS. This should help with the basics.</p>
          <p><li><a href="http://www.linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php">More (GNU/)Linux for Beginners</a></li>
          Someone in IRC said this is very comprehensive, and it looks pretty good, so enjoy. Probably better than the link above, since I just looked up "linux for beginners" and copied the first relevant link</p>
          <p><li><a href="http://silverwraith.com/blog/2011/07/so-you-want-to-be-a-systems-administrator/">Becoming a Sysadmin</a></li>
          Are you a cynical fuck that hates people? Do you have no qualms about working for The Man, knowing that being a cyberpunk won't fill a retirement fund? Do you want to get paid for doing shit that you probably do anyway? Would you forgo the soft caress of a woman in favor of the cold metal of server racks and the humming of fans? A position as a Sysadmin (or Systems Administrator) might be just the thing for you!</p>

Cyberpunk Life in 2014 and Beyond
</h2>
Cyberpunk, for its popularity in games, movies, books, and media general, is surprisingly undefined. There are a few catchphrases that are often thrown around to describe it, like "high-tech, low-life", but with any given piece of media, people are still highly subjective about if they consider it "cyberpunk".
<br><br>
That said, the cyberpunk present in 2014 didn't exactly evolve like we thought it would as recently as 5 years ago, so here are some of my thoughts on modern cyberpunk.<br>
<i>
<br><br>It's better to blend in than to stand out. Drop the edgy punk clothing, you'll just draw attention. Unless you feel the need to go high-tech in public (like wearing an AR system), there's no purpose whatsoever.
<br><br>There's also no point in going high-tech in public unless you have a serious advantage to gain from doing so. Stop and think: What do you immediately gain from AR?
<br><br>Don't throw niche tech into your life where it doesn't belong. You're not more cyberpunk because you embedded LEDs along the seams of your trenchcoat. 
<br><br>Know the genre. Know your lit. Learn from it. Gibson has a gift for identifying nodal points, as he calls them - bits of the future mixed in with the present. 
<br><br>Protect your privacy. Duh.
<br><br>Protect your freedoms. If you're in a country that allows firearm ownership, you have no excuse to not own at least one firearm.
<br><br>Don't call yourself a cyberpunk. Don't believe anyone who calls themselves a cyberpunk. Actually using the label on yourself brands you as a poser. If anything, you live a cyberpunk lifestyle - but you probably don't if you feel the urge to call yourself cyberpunk.
